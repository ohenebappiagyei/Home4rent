## Contributors

Our team consists of 3 individuals. We have Alex, who was dealing with the front-end, because that is what he wants to specialise in, and he was always well ahead with his work, meeting deadlines, way before time.
We, also have Kwame, who deals with back-end, and he is very passionate about it, even going to the extent of learning Django just for this project. He has also done a tremendous job, in spite of the challenges he faced, both technical, and non-technical, but he is a dedicated someone who always delivers on time.
The last member is Ayanda, who was more of a project manager, assisting both front-end, and back-end, and making sure that we were all on track with our dead lines.

## Introduction

Currently, in Ghana, young people, and even some adults who do not have their own homes, find it difficult searching for rooms to let. Most times, exorbitant amounts are charged for just viewing the place advertised. Rental agents also charge their own fees of the total amount of rent paid for 12 months and this is extremely difficult for young people starting life to catch up. We intend to solve this by providing an avenue for clients to view the homes they want to rent as well as try to eliminate the outrageous agent fees.

The project will help young people easily find, and rent homes. The users will be people in need of homes to rent , and people who have homes to rent out. This project is currently relevant to Ghana, but a lot of other African countries can use it.

It is an easy to use app, where you're able to view the available properties without the need of signing up, but you will then need to sign up if you want to rent a property, or if you are a landlord, and you'd like to advertise your property.

## Technologies

For front-end, we chose to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript since we all have some understanding of it and we wanted to further our knowledge on it.
For back-end, we went with Django as we felt that it was more flexible and easier to use, once you have some knowledge on it. We also used python in our back-end as it is very flexible and contains a lot of already available tools and libraries which we can use.
For version control, we chose GitHub over Bitbucket because it offers a lot of add-ons for increasing development productivity and improving collaboration, plus GitHub has a faster performance, and we are more familiar with it as weâ€™ve been using it.

## Challenges

Some time after starting with the project, we were faced with a huge issue of getting the engine of the project, which is the back-end, to function. We were literally at a dead end and it was stressful to each and everyone of us.
The task at hand was the most vital, because a rental app is nothing without the back-end. Not discounting the front-end, which makes the project look good, with all the glitz and the glamour, but without the backend, there was no way of saving any properties that the clients can view, there was no way of saving user details, and so, our project would be useless.
In the midst of all that stress, we were able to put our heads together and try keeping cool heads, so that we could be able to think straight. So we decided that instead of trying to solve all of the problems and functionalities at the same time, let us rather tackle one problem at a time. So we started with the login authorisation feature, and once we got that working we started to tackle other issues, and we were seeing our project reaching completion stage. Up until now, we are still using the same method to tackle all the problems that we still face.

Another challenge which we did not expect and plan for is the loss of internet connectivity for a few days in a lot of countries, and that affected our research, and thus affecting our deadlines.
Because some of these challenges were beyond our control, we had to learn to be flexible and tackle other tasks while we could not follow the initial plan, and we had to learn that needed to put in more hours towards the project because of the time lost.
