## Introduction

Currently, in Ghana, young people, and even some adults who do not have their own homes, find it difficult searching for rooms to let. Most times, exorbitant amounts are charged for just viewing the place advertised. Rental agents also charge their own fees of the total amount of rent paid for 12 months and this is extremely difficult for young people starting life to catch up. We intend to solve this by providing an avenue for clients to view the homes they want to rent as well as try to eliminate the outrageous agent fees.

The project will help young people easily find, and rent homes. The users will be people in need of homes to rent , and people who have homes to rent out. This project is currently relevant to Ghana, but a lot of other African countries can use it.

It is an easy to use app, where you're able to view the available properties without the need of signing up, but you will then need to sign up if you want to rent a property, or if you are a landlord, and you'd like to advertise your property.
You can access our app using this [link](https://h4r.vercel.app/).
